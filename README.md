# tic-tac-toe
This project is a tic tac toe game. It is a two player game, players take their turn by marking their signs either "O" or a "X" on a 3 x 3 board. The player who first gets 3 of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.
